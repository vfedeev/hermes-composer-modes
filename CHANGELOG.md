# Changelog

## 2.1.0 — 2026-09-27

**No hardcoded response language — the plugin answers in the language of the system.**

Upstream shipped an Argentine-Spanish closing sentence in the ask note and Spanish
UI strings across the desktop half, so on any machine the model drifted into Spanish
and the cards spoke Spanish. This release localizes both channels:

- **`i18n.py` (new)**: the response-language ladder — app locale →
  `HERMES_COMPOSER_MODES_LANG` → OS locale (`LANGUAGE/LC_ALL/LC_MESSAGES/LANG`) →
  **English**. Unknown languages degrade to English, never raise, never force a
  specific language. Catalogue of every model-facing sentence (ask closing line,
  answer-language clause, `/mode` replies) keyed by language — the only place those
  sentences live.
- **agent half**: mode notes became per-call factories (`modes.py`) so a locale
  switch reaches the next turn with no reload; `ASK_NOTE`/`PLAN_NOTE`/`DEBUG_NOTE`
  stay importable via PEP-562. Protocol tokens (`::plan-approve`, `::plan-questions`,
  `::debug-loop`) are deliberately never translated — they are parsed by the desktop
  half. The ask note now says *quote this sentence verbatim, in this language*
  instead of carrying one literal Spanish line.
- **state + API**: the store persists `locale` (`state.json`); `POST /locale` reports
  the app language, and every `POST /mode` stage carries it. `GET /state` exposes it.
- **desktop half (VER v13.1 → v14.0)**: all user-facing strings moved into the
  `STR = {en, ru, es}` catalogue, registered through the SDK's plugin-i18n
  (`ctx.i18n.register`) and resolved against the app's active display language —
  components via `usePluginI18n(ID)`, handlers via `ctx.i18n.t`. The app locale is
  read (`useI18n().locale`, hydrated from `navigator.language`) and reported to the
  backend so the model-facing half follows the same language as the UI half. Both
  i18n hooks are taken off the SDK namespace so pre-0.21.4 shells degrade to the
  English bundle instead of failing plugin load.
- **docs**: `docs/localization.md` — the two-channel contract (protocol wording is
  always English; voice localizes), the ladder, the adding-a-language checklist,
  the behavior matrix, and upstream-patch guidance.
- **tests**: 103 → 141. New `tests/test_i18n.py` pins the ladder and the English
  floor; `tests/test_bilingual.py` drives the real chain (API → store → hook) in
  EN↔RU, switches language mid-session A/B/A, and pins that protocol tokens are
  identical in every language; ask-closing tests now assert per-language
  resolution instead of one Spanish literal; store/register cover the locale
  routes. Smoke harness asserts the `/mode` stage carries the locale. The
  multilingual acceptance script `scripts/lang_matrix.py` (also in CI) prints
  the whole ladder per language for human review.
- **pinning the minimum task**: to force Russian regardless of the system, set
  `HERMES_COMPOSER_MODES_LANG=ru` (or pick Русский in app Settings) — no string
  patching needed, which is why the fork did not simply hardcode Russian.

## 2.0.1 — 2026-09-16

**The mode note now reaches the turn — the stage targets the session id the core uses.**

- **fix (desktop half)**: the composer middleware staged the mode against
  `host.state.focusedSessionId`, the runtime *tile* id (`$focusedRuntimeId`). The core fires
  `pre_llm_call` with the stored session id (`agent.session_id`), so the store lookup never
  matched, `get_mode()` answered with the default (`agent`) and no note was ever delivered —
  silently, because from inside a turn "Agent" and "a lost note" look identical. One helper
  (`backendSid()`) now resolves `focusedStoredSessionId` first and falls back to the runtime id
  for shells that do not expose it; the session-change reset stages through the same helper.
- **observability**: the boot `caps` probe prints both ids, so a wrong staging identity is
  visible in `logs/desktop.log` instead of invisible.
- **test**: `scripts/smoke_desktop_half.mjs` asserts the staged `session_id` (red before the fix:
  `staged "sess-runtime" — must stage the stored session id`) and the runtime fallback.
- **verified live** (Hermes 0.21.3): with the fix, `ask`, `plan` and `debug` each frame their
  turn and `agent` stays unframed; `verify_note.py` reports `hidden ok: True` with the typed
  bytes untouched.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-09-16

**The plugin is now a real Hermes plugin package — no core patch, no renderer rebuild.**

- **packaging**: the repository root IS the plugin (`plugin.yaml`, `__init__.py`,
  `modes.py`, `store.py`, `enforce.py`, `dashboard/`, `desktop/`, `skills/`). The v1
  patch pipeline is retired from the tree (history: commit `3d5042e`), so the shipped
  plugin contains no core patch, no installer and nothing that replaces its own files.
- **delivery v13**: the mode travels through supported seams only. The desktop half
  stages the mode with `ctx.rest POST /api/plugins/composer-modes/mode` (awaited inside
  the composer middleware, so the backend knows the mode before the turn is admitted) and
  the agent half returns the note from `pre_llm_call`, which Hermes merges into the
  turn's model-facing bytes (`api_content`) only. `draft.note` and `session.note.stage`
  are gone; the typed text is never rewritten.
- **ask enforcement**: `pre_tool_call` now vetoes state-changing calls in ask mode —
  a deny-list of tools plus any mutating tool name, and a fail-closed read-only
  classifier for `terminal`. `HERMES_COMPOSER_MODES_ASK_ENFORCE=0` disables it.
- **state**: per-session modes in `<hermes home>/plugin-data/composer-modes/state.json`,
  shared by the hooks, the `/mode` command and the REST half, with a 30-day TTL.
- **surfaces**: `/mode ask|agent|plan|debug` works from the CLI, the TUI, the desktop
  composer and messaging platforms; the protocol also ships as a loadable skill
  (`composer-modes:modes`).
- **desktop half**: `desktop/plugin.js` (v13.0) keeps the mode button, `Shift+Tab`
  cycling, the plan approval/questions cards, the plan reader pane and the debug loop
  card, and routes every mode change through one `applyMode` helper (atom + storage +
  backend stage).
- **tests**: `tests/` — 104 pytest cases over modes, store, enforcement, wiring and the
  REST half; `tests/pytest.ini` pins the rootdir (the package needs a root
  `__init__.py`, which pytest cannot import as a package parent).
- **docs**: README/AGENTS/architecture/limits/verification rewritten for the package;
  catalog metadata added (`requires_hermes >= 0.21.3`, declared hooks).

## 12.3.2 — 2026-09-15

- **core-patch**: forward-port the drifted `tui_gateway/AGENTS.md` anchor to upstream
  `afe06f21f4` (2026-09-13) — the base grew a "New event" paragraph between the RPC note
  and `## Key surfaces`; the seam's per-turn-note section now documents the `note` param
  after it. Gates: `patch.py --verify-only` 20/20 anchors, `verify_core.py` VERIFIED,
  import-gate green.
- **desktop-patch**: forward-port four drifted anchors — the `session-tile-actions.ts` and
  `use-prompt-actions/index.ts` import blocks (upstream added `SLASH_COMMAND_RE`,
  `JsonRpcGatewayError`, moved `stripAnsi`, added `ChatMessage`) and the
  `steer-arrival-order.test.tsx` harness (`RpcEvent` → `GatewayEvent`) — plus a full
  refresh of the shipped seam tree to the new base. `gen_ops.py` regenerates all ops
  (32 source + 13 test) with the round-trip proven against the checkout
  (`apply(base) == seam`, byte for byte). Seam gates: `patch_desktop.py --verify-only`
  clean on both sets, the four contract suites green (79/79, vitest).
- **rebuild**: the seam app builds from the patched sources (renderer entry chunk
  changes; the rest of the bundle is byte-identical to stock) and the packaged
  `win-unpacked` swap carries it.

## 12.3.1 - 2026-09-14

- **plugin (v12.3)**: composer mode button UI - the version tag to its right is
  gone; the version now lives in the hover tooltip. The button sits next to the
  model pill in the composer's right cluster and no longer shrinks or wraps
  (`shrink-0` + `whitespace-nowrap`). `VER` is now `v12.3`.
## 12.3.0 - 2026-09-12

- **desktop-patch/**: the desktop-renderer seam (composer-mode frame + per-entry
  queue freeze) now ships in this repo - 14 renderer files as anchored ops
  (`ops.json`, 33 ops) plus the contract tests (`test-ops.json`), generated by
  `gen_ops.py` from a verified diff (round-trip proven byte-for-byte) and applied
  by `patch_desktop.py` (verify -> backup -> apply -> re-verify; create ops for
  new files). The seam tree is kept under `desktop-patch/seam/` for re-anchoring.
- **installer**: new desktop seam step (`install/build-desktop-seam.ps1`):
  applies the ops, rebuilds the app with the checkout toolchain
  (`npm run build` + `electron-builder --dir` into a staging dir), verifies the
  staged build (Hermes.exe + the `fromQueue` renderer marker), stages
  `win-unpacked.new` and schedules the detached `desktop-swap.ps1` (close ->
  backup -> swap -> relaunch). `install.ps1` runs it by default
  (`-SkipDesktopSeam` to skip; a missing node/npm degrades gracefully), and the
  6 h guardian heals both the sources and the app after Hermes updates.
  `uninstall.ps1` restores the renderer sources from its manifest and swaps the
  newest pre-seam app build back.
- **docs**: the pipeline is self-contained (no dependency on any upstream
  branch); the seam is also mirrored upstream as PR #108242 (optional).

## 12.2.3 — 2026-09-12

- **core-patch**: an announced `agent` frame no longer adopts a staged twin. The staged
  channel (v12.2 parity, one slot per session) could hold a queued ask/plan/debug note
  that a later agent send then picked up, stamping it with a foreign mode. `prompt.submit`
  now drops the staged twin when the submit announces `mode=agent` (explicit frames for
  other modes and stageless legacy flows are unchanged).

## 12.2.2 — 2026-09-12

- **installer**: the one-shot backend-restart task (`install.ps1`, `uninstall.ps1`) is now
  created battery-safe (`DisallowStartIfOnBatteries=false`, `StopIfGoingOnBatteries=false`,
  `StartWhenAvailable=true`). Plain `schtasks` defaults blocked it on laptops — the task
  never ran (`0x41303`), so the post-install backend restart silently stalled until the
  next Hermes update. The guardian task was already battery-safe.

## 12.2.1 — 2026-09-12

- **core-patch**: forward-port the three drifted anchors to upstream `1c671bea`
  (2026-09-12): `prompt_turn` `_run_prompt_submit` signature (Collective-Wisdom
  revert upstream), the `session.note.stage` insertion point (new `_CLIENT_SURFACES`
  block), and the refusal re-stage tail (`client_surface` rewrite). Plugin
  unchanged (v12.2). Gates: `patch.py --verify-only` 20/20 anchors,
  `verify_core.py` VERIFIED on the refreshed base.
