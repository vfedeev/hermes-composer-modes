"""Mode catalogue — the single source of truth for what each composer mode does.

The desktop half (``desktop/plugin.js``) only ever sends a mode id; every word
the model reads lives here. Notes are per-turn operating instructions delivered
through the ``pre_llm_call`` hook: Hermes merges them into the model-facing
bytes of the current user message (``api_content``) and the durable row, the
bubble, the sidebar preview and the session title keep exactly what was typed.

Notes are built in English (protocol wording the desktop relies on) plus one
localized tail from ``i18n.py``: the answer-language clause every mode appends
and the mandated ask-mode closing sentence. That is what keeps the model from
straying into a hardcoded language — the old build shipped an Argentine-Spanish
closing line regardless of the user's system (see docs/localization.md).

- Your deliverable is a markdown plan saved inside the active workspace under

  the plan with the workspace on local, docker, ssh, modal, and daytona

PLAN_CRAFT = """Write the plan for an implementer with zero context for the codebase and
questionable taste. A good plan makes implementation obvious — if someone has
to guess, the plan is incomplete.

Structure (include the sections that are relevant):
- Goal — one sentence.
- Current context / assumptions.
- Architecture / proposed approach — 2-3 sentences.
- Step-by-step tasks. Each task is bite-sized (2-5 minutes of focused work),
  names exact file paths (`src/models/user.py`, not "the model file"),
  includes complete copy-pasteable code where code is needed, and exact
  commands with expected output for verification.
- Tests / validation — for code tasks, follow the TDD cycle per task: write
  the failing test, run it to verify failure, implement minimally, run to
  verify pass, commit.
- Risks, tradeoffs, and open questions.

Principles: DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits. Avoid vague tasks ("add
authentication"), incomplete code ("add validation here"), and unverifiable
steps ("test it works" — instead: the exact command and its expected output).

Interaction style:
- If the request is clear enough, write the plan directly.
- If it is genuinely underspecified, ask a brief clarifying question instead
  of guessing.
- After saving the plan, reply briefly with what you planned and the saved
  path, and offer to execute it (e.g. via subagent-driven development) —
  but do not start executing in this turn."""
